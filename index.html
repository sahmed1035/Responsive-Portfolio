        <p>My name is Syeda Ahmed. I am a mother of a 10-year-old boy Jamal. I was born and raised in Pakistan, so I
          speak Urdu in addition to English. In my personal life, I am dedicated to my family, in particular, my son
          Jamal. I studied computer Science concentrating in Database and Data Analysis from DePaul University. Right
          after graduation, I got a job at Abbott Laboratories. After having my son, I decided to stay at home with him
          full-time. I love cooking, learning new recipes, and volunteering. I volunteer for STEM scout classes at my
          son's school, for example. A love for cooking runs in the family as I also support my uncle's pizza place by
          running the Facebook page for the business.
          Now as I see my son has grown up and needs me not as much, I am willing to pursue my career again. I have
          always been passionate about the field of technology and I am always learning something new to ensure that my
          skills are up-to-date. I also hold a certificate in Bio Information System.
        </p>

        <p>But I am not just involved with computers! Sharing knowledge and skills is very important for me.
          I have a motivational page on Facebook, “The Glass is Half Full”, followed by thousands of people. I am also
          working on a project called “Tutors Loop” (www.tutorsloop.net) with a team of exceptional developers. The
          platform connects students and tutors from across the world with a secure payment system. I hope soon it will
          provide a comfortable space for the users to continue learning whatever they want from people around the
          world.
        </p>

        <p>I believe in hard work and learning, and these are values I have exemplified since the beginning of my
          career. I was among the 0.5% of top students in the U.S. for 3 years in a row and have always prided myself
          in the work I do.
          Quality matters to me in everything I do, be it programming or cooking a delicious new recipe.
